The **Composite Design Pattern** is a structural design pattern used to treat a group of objects in the same way as a single object. It allows you to create a tree structure to represent part-whole hierarchies. This pattern is particularly useful when dealing with structures where you want to treat individual objects and compositions of objects uniformly.

### Key Components
1. **Component**: An interface or abstract class defining common operations for both leaf and composite objects.
2. **Leaf**: Represents individual objects that do not have children.
3. **Composite**: Represents objects that can have children. It implements operations to manage child components and delegates tasks to them when necessary.

### Use Cases
- Building menus in a UI application.
- Representing file systems with files and folders.
- Implementing organization hierarchies.

### Example: File System

```java
// Component
interface FileSystemComponent {
    void showDetails();
}

// Leaf
class File implements FileSystemComponent {
    private String name;

    public File(String name) {
        this.name = name;
    }

    @Override
    public void showDetails() {
        System.out.println("File: " + name);
    }
}

// Composite
class Folder implements FileSystemComponent {
    private String name;
    private List<FileSystemComponent> components = new ArrayList<>();

    public Folder(String name) {
        this.name = name;
    }

    public void addComponent(FileSystemComponent component) {
        components.add(component);
    }

    public void removeComponent(FileSystemComponent component) {
        components.remove(component);
    }

    @Override
    public void showDetails() {
        System.out.println("Folder: " + name);
        for (FileSystemComponent component : components) {
            component.showDetails();
        }
    }
}

// Client
public class CompositePatternDemo {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        FileSystemComponent file1 = new File("Document1.txt");
        FileSystemComponent file2 = new File("Photo.jpg");
        FileSystemComponent file3 = new File("Video.mp4");

        Folder folder1 = new Folder("MyDocuments");
        Folder folder2 = new Folder("MyMedia");

        folder1.addComponent(file1);
        folder2.addComponent(file2);
        folder2.addComponent(file3);

        Folder rootFolder = new Folder("Root");
        rootFolder.addComponent(folder1);
        rootFolder.addComponent(folder2);

        // Display the entire structure
        rootFolder.showDetails();
    }
}
```

---

### Output

```
Folder: Root
Folder: MyDocuments
File: Document1.txt
Folder: MyMedia
File: Photo.jpg
File: Video.mp4
```

### Benefits
- Simplifies client code by treating individual and composite objects uniformly.
- Makes it easier to add new types of components.

### Drawbacks
- Can make the design overly general, leading to complexity.
- Harder to restrict certain components to contain specific types of children.
