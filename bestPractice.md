In a Spring Boot application, injecting multiple dependencies into a service layer requires adhering to clean code principles to ensure maintainability, readability, and testability. Here's how you can approach it:

### 1. **Use Constructor-Based Dependency Injection (Best Practice)**
- **Why**: Constructor-based injection is recommended because it ensures that the dependencies are immutable and promotes better testability by allowing you to mock dependencies in unit tests easily.

Example:

```java
@Service
public class MyService {

    private final ServiceA serviceA;
    private final ServiceB serviceB;
    private final ServiceC serviceC;

    public MyService(ServiceA serviceA, ServiceB serviceB, ServiceC serviceC) {
        this.serviceA = serviceA;
        this.serviceB = serviceB;
        this.serviceC = serviceC;
    }

    public void performSomeOperation() {
        serviceA.doSomething();
        serviceB.doSomethingElse();
        serviceC.anotherOperation();
    }
}
```

### 2. **Group Related Services Using a Composite or Facade**
If the injected services share similar responsibilities or are part of a cohesive module, consider creating a **composite service** or a **facade service**. This simplifies the service's constructor and encapsulates the logic in a dedicated layer.

Example:

```java
@Service
public class CompositeService {
    private final ServiceA serviceA;
    private final ServiceB serviceB;

    public CompositeService(ServiceA serviceA, ServiceB serviceB) {
        this.serviceA = serviceA;
        this.serviceB = serviceB;
    }

    public void handleComplexOperation() {
        serviceA.doSomething();
        serviceB.doSomethingElse();
    }
}

@Service
public class MyService {
    private final CompositeService compositeService;

    public MyService(CompositeService compositeService) {
        this.compositeService = compositeService;
    }

    public void performOperation() {
        compositeService.handleComplexOperation();
    }
}
```

### 3. **Avoid Field Injection**
Field injection (using `@Autowired` directly on fields) is less preferable as it makes the code harder to test and violates the principles of immutability.

### 4. **Use `@RequiredArgsConstructor` from Lombok**
If you use Lombok, you can reduce boilerplate by using `@RequiredArgsConstructor` to auto-generate the constructor for all `final` fields.

Example:

```java
@Service
@RequiredArgsConstructor
public class MyService {
    private final ServiceA serviceA;
    private final ServiceB serviceB;

    public void performOperation() {
        serviceA.doSomething();
        serviceB.doSomethingElse();
    }
}
```

### 5. **Leverage Interfaces for Dependency Injection**
Always inject interfaces rather than concrete classes to adhere to the **Dependency Inversion Principle**. This makes your code more flexible and testable.

### 6. **Consider Using `@Qualifier` or `@Primary` for Ambiguity**
If you have multiple implementations of a service and need to specify which one to inject, use `@Qualifier` or `@Primary`.

Example:

```java
@Service
public class MyService {
    private final MyInterface myServiceImplementation;

    public MyService(@Qualifier("specificImplementation") MyInterface myServiceImplementation) {
        this.myServiceImplementation = myServiceImplementation;
    }
}
```

### 7. **Keep the Number of Dependencies Reasonable**
If you find that a class has too many dependencies (e.g., more than 4â€“5), it might indicate that the class is taking on too many responsibilities. Break it into smaller, focused classes to adhere to the **Single Responsibility Principle**.

By following these practices, you can maintain a clean and scalable service layer.
