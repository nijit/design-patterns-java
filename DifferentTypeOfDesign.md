It’s understandable to get confused as these terms overlap in software design, but they are distinct concepts with different purposes. Let's break down each one:

### 1. **Architectural Design Patterns** (High-level design)
   - **What it is**: Architectural design patterns define the structure and organization of an entire software system. They are high-level solutions to problems of organizing software applications.
   - **Scope**: Focuses on how various components of an application interact with each other on a macro level (e.g., how services, modules, or subsystems are structured).
   - **Examples**:
     - **Layered Architecture** (e.g., Presentation, Business, Data layers).
     - **Microservices Architecture** (breaking an app into small, independent services).
     - **Event-Driven Architecture** (components communicate through events).

   **Architectural patterns** are not specific to Java—they apply to any programming language and system.

### 2. **Design Patterns in Java** (Mid-level design)
   - **What it is**: Design patterns in Java refer to reusable solutions to common problems encountered during object-oriented design (OOD). These patterns are more specific than architectural patterns and deal with designing classes and objects.
   - **Scope**: Concerned with the interaction between classes and objects at a more granular level within an application.
   - **Examples** (from the **Gang of Four** patterns):
     - **Creational Patterns** (e.g., Singleton, Factory, Builder).
     - **Structural Patterns** (e.g., Adapter, Decorator, Proxy).
     - **Behavioral Patterns** (e.g., Observer, Strategy, Command).

   **Design patterns** are typically language-specific (like in Java, C#, etc.), but the general principles apply across languages.

### 3. **Microservice Architecture Design Pattern** (Specific architecture pattern)
   - **What it is**: This is a **specific type of architectural design pattern** that focuses on breaking down a large application into smaller, independently deployable services (microservices). Each microservice focuses on a specific business capability and communicates with others using lightweight protocols (e.g., HTTP, message queues).
   - **Scope**: Concerned with how to structure a distributed system of services that work together as a single application.
   - **Examples**:
     - **Service Registry** (to discover microservices).
     - **API Gateway** (centralized entry point to microservices).
     - **Saga Pattern** (managing distributed transactions).

### How They Relate:
- **Architectural Design Patterns** define the overall organization and structure of the system (e.g., whether you use **monolithic architecture** or **microservices architecture**).
- **Design Patterns in Java** focus on solving specific design problems within classes or objects in a Java program, like how to create objects or structure class hierarchies.
- **Microservice Architecture** is a specific kind of architectural design pattern that promotes building applications as a collection of small, independent services.

### Differences:
- **Level of Abstraction**: 
   - **Architectural Design Patterns** are higher-level and impact the whole system.
   - **Design Patterns in Java** are more granular and focus on interactions between objects.
   - **Microservice Architecture** is one type of architectural pattern, specifically for distributed systems.

In summary:
- **Architectural design patterns** focus on how the system is structured.
- **Design patterns in Java** deal with class/object design and are typically more specific and lower-level.
- **Microservice architecture** is a type of architectural pattern used for building distributed systems.
